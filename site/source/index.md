# Mobi.css

> A lightweight, flexible css framework that focus on mobile.

## Introduction

- Only 3.6kb after gzipped, less than Skeleton, Pure.css and Bootstrap v4, etc.
- Heavy use of flexbox, super flexible, less than 10 lines of custom style in the [Homepage](http://getmobicss.com/).
- Focus on mobile, show mobile pages in desktop with a sidebar on the left or right.

## Getting started

You can download Mobi.css in [this page](https://github.com/xcatliu/mobi.css/releases), then use `dist/mobi.min.css` for the compressed version.

Or use npm to install:

```shell
npm install --save mobi.css
```

You can also build Mobi.css to your project if you are using sass.

```scss
@import 'mobi.css/src/mobi';
```

Be sure you have added `node_modules` to your sass's [load_paths](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6502313/sass-import-a-file-from-a-different-directory).
